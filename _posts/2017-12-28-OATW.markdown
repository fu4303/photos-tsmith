I couldn't believe we did it
the [first time]({% post_url 2015-08-29-GWR %}), or even the
[second]({% post_url 2017-05-15-TQ2O %}), but we got tired of not driving
so we took cars we already own on an overland tour of western Oklahoma, which
proved full of surprises. 

- Day 1: Turner Falls Park, Clear Creek Lake, Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge
- Day 2: Quartz Mountain, Black Kettle National Grasslands
- Day 3: Gloss Mountain, The Great Salt Plains
- Day 4: Salt Fork River, Keystone Dam

As before, I chronicled our adventures on [the Travelogue](http://travelogue.news).
