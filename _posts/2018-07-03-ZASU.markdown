[Zilker Theatre Productions](https://zilker.org) presents its 60th annual summer
musical, _All Shook Up!_ After a challenging photoshoot for
[last year's _Wizard of Oz_]({% post_url 2017-07-06-ZWOSO %}) done during the
soft-open donor preview night, the photoshoot was moved up to the final dress
rehearsal. Despite being in the open park, the hillside was pretty sparse, which
made it easier to run around and get better angles. _All Shook Up_ is a lesser
known show than our recent past productions, but I love the freedom we gain by
being able to expose the audience to a new piece free from expectations of
performances they may have seen in the past. It's a great show and runs this
summer, Thursday through Sunday nights, until August 18th starting at 8:15pm.
