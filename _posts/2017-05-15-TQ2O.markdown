I couldn't believe we did it
the [first time]({% post_url 2015-08-29-GWR %}), and now we've done it
again. In cars we bought for a pittance over the internet, we set out
from Sacramento headed for Salt Lake City by way of Lake Tahoe, Death
Valley, Las Vegas, Lake Mead, Valley of Fire, Gold Butte, Grand Canyon
Parashant, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Escalante, and Capitol Reef National
Park. What a ride.

I chronicled our adventures on
[the Travelogue](http://travelogue.news) and wrote about that
[little project on my blog](https://www.tsmithcreative.com/blog/2017/building-travelogue/?utm_source=tsmithphotos&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=tsmithphotos).

Here are some of my best photos, and some of my favorite vacation
snapshots from our adventures. Damn, I miss my 4Runner.
