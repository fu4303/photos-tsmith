Over the past twenty-nine hundred miles: I almost got lost on White Sands
National Monument, wrote a presentation, gave a presentation, offroaded to the
top of 13k foot Mount McClelland, found a ghost town poisoned with mercury and
arsenic and lead at the Santiago Mine, changed a flat, changed it back, cussed
out a terrible jack, visited an old family reunion ground at Grand Lake, hiked 8
miles, saw the best sunset Rocky Mountain National Park has ever had, attended
meetings from a lakeshore boardwalk, did design research in a hammock in the
woods, got the privilege of participating in a Bar Mitzvah, tried bouldering in
hiking boots (don't) at Garden of the Gods (do), drove on a rickety wooden
bridge, convinced some dear friends to go on a hike that ended up being a
StairMaster, had a great backyard bbq, worked remotely from a truck stop, found
some old spray-painted Cadillacs in a field, and made it home safe at 3am.

30th birthday for me, 50k on the Xterra (first introduced in
[OAT East]({% post_url 2018-03-28-TQOATE %})).
